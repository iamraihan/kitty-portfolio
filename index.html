        <p>Cats are wonderful pets. They are very cute and sweet and very gentle too. I have many friends who have cats
            as their pets. Cats are bubbly and lively too. I also have a cat as my pet and I love her very much.</p>

        <h3>Kitty Need Critical Care</h3>
        <p>When he started to grow, we trained hsr for his toiletry habits and on playing with us. he is a very
            intelligent cat and understands very fast what we tell her. She is now big and walks across the lawn with
            all the pride that he could.</p>
